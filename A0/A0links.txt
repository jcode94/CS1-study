		Note the flow diagram on this page. You will see this method of visualization of logic repeatedly 
		throughout ALL your time coding. There is a reason. It is a simple and effective way to organize concepts.
		I highly recommend you try to make one yourself for this project. Time spent coding should be the least 
		of your efforts. Time spent building sound logic should be where you invest most of your time.
