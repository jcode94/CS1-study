/* 
* insert to BST: O(n) - all nodes are on one side so it is basically a linked 
*     list
* remove from AVL tree: O(log(n)) - AVL trees are always balanced, so the 
*     average big Oh is the same as worst case
* remove tail from Doubly linked list: I(n) - we have to traverse to the tail 
*     first which is O(n)
* add tail to Circular Linked List: O(1) and what would be the worst case for
*     adding a value to the head? O(1)
* remove node at position n in circular linked list: O(n)
* add a value at position n on doubly linked list 
*     (storing both head and tail): O(n)

/* 
* Topics that will be on the exam:
1. AVL trees
2. BST
3. Stack
4. Queues
5. Postfix and Infix
6. Singly linked lists
7. Doubly Linked lists
8. Circulat singly linked list
9. Circular doubly linked list
10. structs for linked lists

Things to focus on:
  - big of questions about different data structures
  - stacks(LIFO)
